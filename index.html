      <h4>Project Summary</h4>
      <p class="lead">Denver Cat Company is a non-profit cat rescue. This was my first project having first hand experience with a client. This case study will tell the story of our mistakes and the learning experience we gained. Two designs were created; one before meeting with the client & one after meeting with the client. -Team of 4 with a deadline of 2 weeks-

                <p>The Double Diamond Process promotes creativity and innovation, while making it clear when decisions should be made and when teams should commit to a direction. A successful Double Diamond Process ensures that product requirements and design work are focused on user needs. The Double Diamond diagram illustrates two modes of thinking that occur during the strategy and execution stages of the design process. Teams can use divergent thinking to explore many possible solutions and generate novel ideas. The second stage is dedicated to convergent thinking, which helps to analyze, filter, and focus ideas, bringing clarity and direction to the design process.</p>

We then create an interview plan to gain insight on users' problems and needs. Interviews are conducted then, those transcripts and the information gained are used to create Affinity Diagrams and Empathy Maps. With that information we are able to understand our user and create a more defined User Persona. After defining our problem statement and our solution we created a journey map and storyboard corresponding with our user persona. We then began the ideation process where we; created lofi wireframes/prototypes, performed brain writing exercises, feature prioritization matrix, competitor analysis, and user flows. User testing was performed after the ideation process and continued thoughout the rest of the design process. Using the User Flow chart we established a User Task Plan to conduct more testing. We then applied what we learned from the user testing to iterate our design and conduct more user testing, including A/B Testing.<br></p>

                <p>We began our process with creating a user Proto-Persona as a basis our user. The proto persona is a made up user that we create based on our assumptions of the type of person that would use our site or app. In the case of Denver Cat Company we at least knew that the typical user at least likes cats and most likely wants to adopt a cat from the site.</p></div>

We then conducted 5 interviews. We asked a variety of questions to a variety of potential users. We wanted to know what are the users' goals, interests, likes, and most importantly pain points.

Empathy Maps help us better understand how our user thinks, how our user feels, what they do, what they say, what they need/want, and what problems they experience.<br></p>

Paul is looking for a cat that has dog like personality traits. He has grown up with dogs, so he is looking for an animal that is more independent to match his busy schedule.

It involves a group of people writing down ideas, one idea per person, on a piece of paper. All the ideas are then pooled together and discussed to come up with a solution. This method allows for more ideas and perspectives to be shared, as everyone in the group participates and offers their ideas. The goal is to come up with a creative and innovative solution to a problem. Brain writing can be used in any situation where problem-solving is necessary.<br></p>

            <p>A feature prioritization matrix is a tool to decide which features are most important in a product. You assign a value to the features and rank them according to the value. For example, if the value of a feature is high and the cost (or complexity) is low, then it is more important than a feature with low value and high cost (or complexity). This matrix can help decide which features to include in the new site or which features to focus on in the existing site. As you can see, we used our results from our brain writing exercise.

In order to ensure that the testers could complete the tasks without any interference, the goal was given to the tester, and the necessary steps to complete the task were made available to the one conducting the tests. The four goals were: Browse the website, Find more information about the cats, Find out who the founder of Denver Cat Company is, and Book an appointment. With a 100% success rate, the user test plan was successful in achieving its goals. </p> <p>The testers found the user experience to be straightforward and easy to use, with all of the paths necessary to complete the tasks being clearly laid out. The UI also earned high praise from testers, which appreciated the fun animations and pleasant aesthetics. The results of this user test plan highlight the effectiveness of having clearly laid out goals and paths for users to follow.

            <p>This website redesign was a school project so we had to work within the given time frame. Unfortunately, our client meeting was later than expected. Therefore, we had to continue with class and continue our research and design process.</p> 
             <p> Our redesign of the company website was inspired by the iconic architecture of the Denver Cat Company building itself. This architecture reflects the welcoming and down-to-earth atmosphere of the company, which makes customers feel as if they are at home. This design gives our website a more personal feel that customers can remember for years to come.

                <p style="text-align: left;" class="mbr-text mbr-white mbr-regular mbr-black mbr-fonts-style display-12">We began our low fidelity wireframes with the building as the base of every page. We created the Homepage, Gift Cards & Memberships page, and The Cats page. Later, after a thorough review of the existing website, we discovered an Arts & Cats (Crafts) page that would need to be added to our designs. There were two main call-to-actions: a 'Donate' button and a 'Book A Visit' button. We decided to prioritize the 'Donate' button at the top of the hierarchy. The 'Book A Visit' button was placed on the door, along with store information such as location, hours of operations, and phone number. The original site also had a newsletter with a statement about how they "might not answer back," so it was placed at the bottom. In later iterations, the newsletter sign up was moved to the Gift Cards & Memberships page.</p>

                <p style="text-align: left;" class="mbr-text mbr-white mbr-regular mbr-black mbr-fonts-style display-12">Our color palette and gradient is based on the building's color scheme. The logo features a yellow frame around a cat, with the subtext "Art.Cats.Cafe." beneath the company name. We added a frame that appears behind the button when hovered, to emphasize the crafts shop. Our header text is in Oxygen Mono font, button text is in Antonio font, and body text is in Public Sans font. We would later find out that the building was remodeled during this redesign, but the color scheme stayed the same.</p>

                <p style="text-align: left;" class="mbr-text mbr-white mbr-regular mbr-black mbr-fonts-style display-12">The homepage wireframes went through several changes before the client meeting. We put the newsletter at the bottom, as the existing website suggested it was of low priority. We struggled to decide what color to make the sign-up bar, but eventually settled on placing the newsletter sign-up at the bottom of the Membership/Gift Cards page. The donate button was placed above the door, next to the streetlamp, which would light up the button when hovered over. The door has all the company information on it. Upon hovering, it cracks open, revealing a cat peeking outside and a ball of yarn that rolls out to the 'O' in the company name, just like in the logo. The buttons, located in the windows, take the user to the specified page when clicked. When hovered over, a picture frame with the corresponding image appears.</p>

                <p style="text-align: left;" class="mbr-text mbr-white mbr-regular mbr-black mbr-fonts-style display-12">The Denver Cat Company website consists of five main pages. The homepage fits the screen and is non-scrollable. The Cats page has photos of the cats that enlarge when clicked and show additional information about them. The "Book Visit" button takes you to a page with an appointment form. The Shop page has a Membership section, Gift Card section, and Newsletter section, with top navigation to go to each section with one click. The Arts & Cats (crafts) page is the longest, with many options from yoga and pumpkin carving to over 20 different painting sessions, each with their own page when clicked. The About page has information about the company, along with photos of the founder, team, and building interior. We incorporated the yellow frame aesthetic with plans to use the exact frame shown in the company logo in later iterations. The top of the building, donate button (CTA), lamp post, and socials all stay fixed to the top during scrolling.</p>

We kept the building look of the homepage by using the building frame, door, and lamp post. The frames that pop up from behind the buttons upon hover in the desktop version became the buttons themselves for the mobile version. The grid layout changes in the mobile version to improve user interactions and accessibility. The lamp post is only on the homepage, rather than all pages, to save space and reduce clutter. The two call to actions, ‘Donate & Book Visit’ buttons, and everything above them, stay fixed to the top during scrolling.</p>

We incorporated the building into the design wireframes and added more fun interactions throughout the website prototype, such as the lamp post shining light on the donate button when hovered over. The buttons in the windows take the user to the specified page when clicked. When hovered over, a picture frame with the corresponding image appears. The pages are laid out in a simple, digestible way to ensure a better user experience. In this early prototype, some consistency fixes should be made.<br></p>

            <p>We were grateful that the client, founder of Denver Cat Company, took the time to meet with us despite their busy schedule. We had forty minutes to discuss the project before her next meeting. We presented her with our research and prototype, and she liked it, but it wasn't the direction she wanted to go with the redesign. She explained that the arts and crafts portion of the company had been eliminated. The frame in the logo, the 'Art.Cats.Cafe' logo subtext, and the paintbrush decal in the window were all discarded. She also mentioned that she is in the process of removing the memberships and gift cards. We learned that while she liked the darker background color, she wanted the site to be all on one page, more like a blog setup. We had to rapidly redesign our prototype to meet the client's needs before the deadline.</p>

The subtext under the company name was changed from “Arts.Cats.Cafe.” to “Because Cats”.  The hover state for the main section buttons no longer has a frame peeking from behind.</p>

            <p>We were able to make the iterations for the design after speaking with the client while still keeping it user focused. She was very busy and we were appreciative for her taking the time to meet with us. We were not able to get as much into explaining the user research that we conducted. So the site is more redesigned into what the client wants vs what the user needs. If I could go back I would try to explain more what User Experience Design is and why user focus is so important.
