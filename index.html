      <h4>Project Summary</h4>
      <p class="lead">Denver Cat Company is a non-profit cat rescue. This was my first project having first hand experience with a client. This case study will tell the story of our mistakes and the learning experience we gained. Two designs were created; one before meeting with the client & one after meeting with the client.

                <p>This is the Double Diamond Process and it promotes creativity and innovation while making it clear when decisions should be made and when teams should commit to a direction. A well-executed double diamond process ensures that product requirements and subsequent design work are focused on user needs.

                    The double diamond diagram illustrates two modes of thinking that occur during the strategy and execution stages of the design process. Teams can leverage divergent thinking to explore many possible solutions and generate novel ideas. The second stage is dedicated to convergent thinking to analyze, filter, and focus ideas in order to bring clarity and direction to the design process.</p>

We then create an interview plan to gain insight on users' problems and needs. Interviews are conducted and those transcripts and the information gained are used to create Affinity Diagrams and Empathy Maps. With that information are able to understand our user and create a more defined User Persona. After defining our problem statement and our solution we create a journey map and storyboard using our user persona. We can then begin the ideation process where we create lofi wireframes/prototypes, perform brain writing exercises, feature prioritization matrix, competitor analysis, and user flows. User testing is performed after the ideation process and continued thoughout the rest of the design process. Using the User Flow chart we come up with a User Task Plan and conduct more testing. We then apply what we learned from the user testing to iterate our design and conduct more user testing, including A/B Testing.<br></p>

            <p>We were able to make the iterations for the design after speaking with the client while still keeping it user focused. She was very busy and we were appreciative for her taking the time to meet with us. We were not able to get as much into explaining the user research that we conducted. So the site is more redesigned into what the client wants vs what the user needs. If I could go back I would try to explain more what User Experience Design is and why user focus is so important.

Unfortunately, our client meeting was later than expected. Therefore, we had to continue with class and continue our research and design process. The Denver Cat Company building is very iconic and memorable and reflects the down to earth "homeliness" of the company. We then, incorporated the building into the design wireframes. We also added more fun interactions throughout the website prototype, such as the lamp post shining light on the donate button upon hovering.<br></p>
