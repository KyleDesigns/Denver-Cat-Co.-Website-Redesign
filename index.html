      <h4>Project Summary</h4>
      <p class="lead">Denver Cat Company is a non-profit cat rescue. This was my first project having first hand experience with a client. This case study will tell the story of our mistakes and the learning experience we gained. Two designs were created; one before meeting with the client & one after meeting with the client.

    <p>Through conducting user interviews, creating affinity diagrams, empathy maps, and user testing we discovered that users have problems with not getting enough information about the cat they want to adopt and problems with the site not being updated with currently available cats.</p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-white mbr-regular mbr-black mbr-fonts-style display-12">After conducting interview transcripts we then translated that information into user personas, affinity diagram, empathy map, journey map, brain writings, feature prioritization matrix, competitor analysis, and user flows . We worked as a team through the user research/testing and ideation process. Our teammate, Gabby, did the storyboarding on her own and did a great job!<br></p>

                <p>We were able to make the iterations for the design after speaking with the client while still keeping it user focused. She was very busy and we were appreciative for her taking the time to meet with us. We were not able to get as much into explaining the user research that we conducted. So the site is more redesigned into what the client wants vs what the user needs. If I could go back I would try to explain more what User Experience Design is and why user focus is so important.

                  <p class="mbr-text mbr-white mbr-regular mbr-black mbr-fonts-style display-12">This website redesign was a school project so we had to work within the given time frame. Unfortunately, our client meeting was later than expected. Therefore, we had to continue with class and continue our research and design process. The Denver Cat Company building is very iconic and memorable and reflects the down to earth "homeliness" of the company. We then, incorporated the building into the design wireframes. We also added more fun interactions throughout the website prototype, such as the lamp post shining light on the donate button upon hovering.<br></p>
